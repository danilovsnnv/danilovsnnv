## AI/ML Engineer

I have a academic foundation in applied mathematics and computer science, earned during my bachelor’s studies at Saint Petersburg State University of Economics. There, I gained a solid understanding of mathematics, economics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at ITMO University — one of Russia’s leading institutions in the field of data science.

Professionally, I work as a Data Scientist at Sberbank, the largest bank in Eastern Europe. My main focus is time series forecasting. I’ve worked on models for predicting corporate client activity, customer lifetime value (CLTV), and ecosystem engagement. My responsibilities include designing experiments, analyzing model forecasts, improving prediction quality, and presenting results to business stakeholders.

In addition to my corporate experience, I contributed to the launch of Udarnik AI, a startup focused on ML services powered by large language models (LLMs). I was responsible for building machine learning services, data sourcing and validation, and system development.

I’m particularly interested in building scalable, production-ready ML systems and applying machine learning to solve real-world business problems. Always open to meaningful collaboration and continuous learning.
